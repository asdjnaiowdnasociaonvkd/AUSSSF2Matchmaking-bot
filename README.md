# AUSSSF2Matchmaking-bot
So anyways i got tired of JSG constantly talking about a ranked matchmaking bot but never seeing one appear
You'll need the npm packages discord.js, glicko2, and googleapis
guildId will have to be replaced with the id of the guild you're using it for
bot token will have to be provided, as well as the google sheets credentials
